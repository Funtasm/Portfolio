This is just a depository for code I have worked on in the past, in the event that I may need snippets of code of things I have previously worked on.

Scanner - A multiplication and division parser and interpreter using binary trees.

BankingV1- A java project worked on by myself and four other group members. It contains no real functions of value nor is it finished, it only served to show Java syntax familiarity.

Frequency Search and Move Rover - a collection of the Verilog files used in making a BASYS3 controlled rover move towards various frequencies in a specific order. The tank styled
rover was controlled by an H-bridge circuit provided by Texas Tech, and the BASYS3 board was used as a means of controlling the H-bridge, the two mic peripherals used, the LED
displayed as a debugging measure, and housing the logic to control all three. The code was entirely composed by myself, while my other three group members for this project were
tasked with ensuring the device's analog microphone signal be filtered into a readable digital signal for the BASYS3 board.

SocketPython - The default socket example in python with added comments and the ability to request time from the server side by the client side.
